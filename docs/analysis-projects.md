title: "Create an analysis project"
---

An analysis project is a workspace for building, collaborating on, and sharing a collection of related qualitative and quantitative analyses. You can save the state of any analysis as an "insight" that you can share or use as a bookmark to jump back into your workflow.

??? list "To create an analysis project"

    1. On the home page, click **New Analysis Project**.
    2. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for your project.
    3. Click **Save & Finish**.

## Plan an analysis

Each analysis project has an analysis checklist that helps you capture the questions and lines of inquiry you want to address. You can use the checklist to:

- Record your hypotheses.
- Plan your analysis.
- Collaborate with other analysts.
- Organize your findings.
- Review progress.

As you build your analyses, you can attach evidence to each section of the checklist in the form of bookmarked [insights](insights.md) that capture the state of the analysis.

## Create an analysis

A project can contain any number of related [data-driven index models](index-graph.md). With each analysis you can:

- Represent a complex system as a set of concepts back by evidence from scientific literature and high-fidelity datasets.
- Visualize cascading effects of change from different scenarios.
